QUESTION: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals? 

APPROACH:
Standard deviation per measure_id (i.e. procedure) is used to measure the variability of procedures. It is an appropriate approach since the standard deviation measures how far the score for a procedure is from the mean. Higher the standard deviation, more spread out are the scores around the mean which can be interpreted as higher variability of the procedures among hospitals.

Since the scores do not have the same measure type, in order to compare the standard deviations with the units, standard deviations have been calculated separately for 2 groups:
1) score that is a rate measure
2) score that is a time measure


CONCLUSION:
For rate scores, the top 10 procedures with greatest variabilities have standard deviation that are not too different. Also the procedures vary.

For the time scores, the top 10 procedures with greatest variabilities have standard deviation that are very different: average time patients spent in the emergency department have significantly higher variability than other procedures.
